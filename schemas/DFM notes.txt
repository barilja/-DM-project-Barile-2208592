DFM notes:
integrity constraint on track.releaseDate and title.releaseDate
integrity constraint on BirthYear and DeathYear
FullCoverage on every dimensional attributes
Shared Hierarchy on Artist dimension
Why no date dimension? No analysis needed on that aspect
Multiple arcs on title and artist dimensions
Optional attributes on artist and title dimensions
Additivity of the measures
